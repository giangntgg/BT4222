# BT4222: Predicting Stock Prices of Singapore Airlines During COVID-19 Period Using Twitter Sentiment
This is the code for BT4222 project group 9
It includes 2 folders - Singapore Airlines, and Amazon (project extension)

1. Please run the codes by STEP 1 >> STEP 2 >> STEP 3 >> STEP 4 >> STEP 5
2. STEP 1 code might meet some issues due to Twitter's restriction of data mining
In such case, please run each hashtag mined respectively. Between each hashtags, wait for around 3-5 minutes. 
3. Alternative, we have also zipped in our data files so that the codes could be run without mining the Twitter files again.
